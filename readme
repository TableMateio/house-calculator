Below is a “formula palette” you can lift straight into a spreadsheet, a Jupyter notebook, or even an n-8n calculator node. I’ve grouped everything by what you plug in (inputs), what the model spits out (derived values), and the guard-rails lenders (and you) care about (tests & thresholds).
Use or ignore pieces as you like—nothing here forces you to commit.

2  Derived monthly values

GMI  = (N_inc + S_inc) / 12                    # gross monthly income
Loan = H_price * (1 - DP_pct)
r    = i_yr / 12                               # monthly rate
n    = T_yrs * 12                              # total number of payments

# Core mortgage payment (principal & interest)
PI   = Loan * r * (1 + r)**n / ((1 + r)**n - 1)

# Monthly add-ons
Tax  = H_price * PT_rate / 12
Ins  = H_price * HI_rate / 12
PMI  = (Loan * PMI_rate / 12)  if DP_pct < 0.20  else 0

PITI = PI + Tax + Ins + PMI                    # full housing payment


⸻

3  Debt-to-Income ratios

Front_end = PITI / GMI                          # “housing ratio”
Back_end  = (PITI + OMD) / GMI                  # “total DTI”

Common comfort bands (edit to taste)

Band	Front_end max	Back_end max	Comment
Conservative	0.28	0.36	Classic underwriting
Moderate	0.33	0.43	Many jumbo, FHA, VA
Aggressive	0.40	0.45	Niche / asset-based

Absolute Fannie/Freddie ceiling: Back_end 0.43.
Non-QM lenders sometimes stretch to 0.50-0.55, but pricing jumps.

⸻

4  Turn a ratio into a max house price
	1.	Pick a ratio target →
PITI_max = TargetRatio * GMI – OMD  (use Front_end if you want a purist view).
	2.	Find Loan:
Rearrange the payment formula:

PaymentFactor = r * (1 + r)**n / ((1 + r)**n - 1)
Loan_max      = (PITI_max - Tax - Ins - PMI) / PaymentFactor

(Tax, Ins, PMI depend on H_price, so iterate twice or start with an estimated rate such as Tax = 0.0125 * H_price / 12 and refine.)
	3.	Back into price:
H_price_max = Loan_max / (1 - DP_pct)

⸻

5  Cash-on-hand test

Down_pmt  = H_price * DP_pct
Clos_cost = H_price * CC_pct
Reserves  = PITI * Res_mo
Total_cash_needed = Down_pmt + Clos_cost + Reserves

Cash_pass = Total_cash_needed ≤ Cash_avail      # Boolean TRUE/FALSE


⸻

6  Net-worth sanity check (totally optional)

NetWorth   = TotalAssets - TotalLiabilities
HomeEquity = Down_pmt                           # ignoring early principal pay-down
Equity_pct_of_NW = HomeEquity / NetWorth

# Heuristics
Conservative ≤ 0.30
Moderate     ≤ 0.50
Aggressive   ≤ 0.65


⸻

7  Stress test for a lay-off

Layoff_cash_months = Cash_avail / PITI

Layoff_pass = Layoff_cash_months ≥ 12           # survive a year on cash


⸻

8  Rent-vs-buy (5-year quick model)

# Inputs
Rent0      = current rent per month
Rent_inf   = assumed annual rent inflation (decimal)
Inv_ret    = assumed annual return on invested down-payment
App_rate   = assumed annual home appreciation
Years      = horizon (e.g., 5)

# Formulas
FV_down = Down_pmt * (1 + Inv_ret)**Years

Total_rent = SUM_{t=0}^{Years-1} Rent0 * (1 + Rent_inf)^t * 12

Home_val_future = H_price * (1 + App_rate)**Years

Loan_bal_future = Loan * (1 + r)**n - PI * (((1 + r)**n - (1 + r)**(Years*12)) / r)

Equity_future = Home_val_future - Loan_bal_future

Net_buy_gain = Equity_future - (FV_down)       # ignores selling costs & tax


⸻

Putting it to work
	1.	Plug in all the blue-box inputs.
	2.	Compute section 2 values.
	3.	Run section 3 to see if the deal hits your chosen DTI band.
	4.	Check section 5 cash.
	5.	(Optional) sanity-check section 6 Net-worth share and section 7 lay-off buffer.
	6.	Use section 8 if you want a rent-vs-buy dashboard.

Now you have a single list of equations you can drop into Excel, Sheets, Notion, Python, or an Airtable formula field. Tweak any input and watch the affordability lights turn green—or red—instantly.
